# GitHub UserFinder

This repository contains a web application that allows users to search for other GitHub users and view their profiles. The application was built using JavaScript and the GitHub API, and is designed to be fast, responsive, and user-friendly.

## How it Works

The application uses the GitHub API to search for users based on their username. When a user submits a search query, the application sends a GET request to the API, which returns a list of matching users along with their profile information. The application then renders the results using JavaScript and displays them on the page.
